Derivative Calculator:
A simple polynomial derivative finder. Used as part of my polynomial root calculator using Newton's method. Requires you enter things like "3x^2 - 2x + 3" (Spaces are necessary)

Enter your polynomial:
4x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 9
Derivative:
12x^2 + -6x + 4

Enter your polynomial:
-4x^-3 + 5x
Derivative:
12x^-4 + 5


Root Finder:
Solution using Newton's Method for finding polynomial roots. I believe there are some limitations on this mathematical method itself, which might not always result in convergence to a root. However, you can just choose a better guess and it should work I think.

Sample Runs:
Enter your polynomial:
3x^4 + 2x^2 - 100
Enter a initial guess:
0
Root = 2.3344773292407677

Enter your polynomial:
2x^2 - 1
Enter a initial guess:
0
Root = 0.7071078431372549

Enter your polynomial:
100x^5 - 30x + 10
Enter a initial guess:
0
Root = 0.35112288416251736

Enter your polynomial:
4x^2 - 16
Enter a initial guess:
0
Root = 2.0000000929222947


St. Petersburg Paradox:
Implementation of the interesting St. Petersburg Paradox! 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox

This program runs the game as many times as you want and returns the maximum payoff and the exepcted payoff. Note the large variance in expected payoff even as number of runs gets large.

Sample Runs:
